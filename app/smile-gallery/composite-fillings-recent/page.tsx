const STEPS = [
  {
    title: "Numb the area gently",
    body: "We start with a small amount of topical anesthetic before any injection — so the local anesthesia itself feels like nothing. Most patients are surprised by how comfortable it is.",
  },
  {
    title: "Remove decay & prep the tooth",
    body: "We carefully remove only the damaged or decayed tooth structure. Composite bonds chemically, so we don't need to over-prep the way we do with amalgam — most of your healthy tooth stays intact.",
  },
  {
    title: "Match the shade",
    body: "We hold a shade guide against your tooth in natural light and pick the closest match. The composite color is mixed to disappear into the rest of the tooth — no obvious filling line.",
  },
  {
    title: "Sculpt in layers",
    body: "Composite is applied in thin layers, each one shaped to your tooth's natural contour. Between layers, a small UV light cures the material — bonding it permanently in place.",
  },
  {
    title: "Polish to a natural shine",
    body: "Once the shape is right, we polish the surface to match the way natural enamel reflects light. By the time you leave, the only way to tell you had work done is the receipt.",
  },
];

const FAQS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    q: "How long does a composite filling take?",
    a: "Most composite fillings — even on visible front teeth — are placed in a single appointment. The whole visit, including numbing and polishing, typically runs 30 to 60 minutes depending on the size of the repair.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my composite filling be visible?",
    a: "No. We shade-match the composite to your surrounding tooth and polish it to mimic the way natural enamel catches light. Once it's in, even a dentist usually has to look closely to find it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a composite filling last?",
    a: "With good oral hygiene and regular checkups, composite fillings typically last 7 to 10 years — sometimes longer. Like any restoration, lifespan depends on size, location, and bite forces. We check yours at every cleaning.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can composite replace my old silver fillings?",
    a: "Yes. We can replace amalgam fillings with composite at your request. It's a great way to remove visible silver from your smile, and many patients find the swap cosmetically dramatic — especially on lower molars that show when you laugh.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are composite fillings safe?",
    a: "Yes. Composite resins are biocompatible, contain no mercury, and have been the standard for cosmetic restorative work for decades. The bonding agents we use are FDA-approved and well-studied.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does aftercare involve?",
    a: "There's no special routine — just brush twice daily, floss every day, and skip biting hard objects like ice or pen caps. Composite is durable but, like a natural tooth, it can chip under enough force.",
  },
