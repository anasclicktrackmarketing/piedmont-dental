                "Tooth decay — one of the leading causes of tooth loss — occurs when acids in plaque erode natural enamel. Decay's treatment often requires complex dental procedures, but it can easily be prevented with proper home hygiene.",
                "Periodontal disease is a progressive condition caused by toxins in plaque. It can lead to tooth loss, gum recession, jawbone recession, and serious health problems elsewhere in the body. Removing plaque and calculus from teeth (with a toothbrush) and from interdental areas (with floss) is an excellent way to stave off periodontal problems.",
                "Halitosis (bad breath) is usually caused by old food particles on or between teeth. These particles can be removed with regular brushing and flossing. And staining or yellowing — caused by smoking, coffee, tea, and other agents — is much less likely to become permanent the more regularly you remove the staining agents.",

The head needs to be small enough to access all areas of the mouth, and the bristles soft enough not to damage gum tissue. The ADA endorses electric toothbrushes — particularly those with rotating or oscillating heads — as more effective than manual brushes.",

              a: "Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to where your gums meet your teeth. Use small, gentle, circular motions — not back-and-forth scrubbing. Cover every surface of every tooth (outside, inside, chewing surface). Pay extra attention to the back molars and the inside of your front teeth, which most people miss. Two minutes total, twice a day.",
            },
            {
              q: "Is harder pressure better when brushing?",
              a: "No — and it's actively harmful. Hard pressure with a stiff brush wears down enamel and pushes gums into recession. Use a soft-bristled brush and gentle pressure: if the bristles are splayed flat, you're pushing too hard. Electric toothbrushes do the work for you — you only need to guide them along the gumline.",
            },
            {
              q: "Why does my floss bleed when I use it?",
              a: "Bleeding gums almost always mean inflammation from plaque sitting along or under the gumline — this is gingivitis, the earliest stage of gum disease. Counterintuitively, the solution is to floss more, not less. With consistent daily flossing for 1–2 weeks, healthy gums stop bleeding. If bleeding persists after two weeks, schedule a visit.",
            },
            {
              q: "Can I use a water flosser instead of regular floss?",
              a: "Water flossers are an excellent supplement and especially helpful around braces, bridges, implants, and tight contacts. For most patients we recommend both — string floss to mechanically disrupt plaque between teeth, water flosser to flush debris from under the gumline. If string floss is impossible for you, a water flosser used daily is much better than nothing.",
            },
            {
              q: "Should I brush before or after breakfast?",
              a: "Either works — the key is consistency. Brushing before breakfast removes the overnight bacterial buildup and lays down a layer of fluoride before you eat. Brushing after breakfast cleans away food debris. If you eat something acidic (citrus juice, coffee, etc.), wait 30 minutes before brushing to avoid scrubbing softened enamel.",
            },
            {
              q: "How can I tell if my toothbrush is too hard?",
              a: "Look at the bristles after a few weeks of use — if they're splayed outward, matted, or bent over, the brush is wearing out (or you're pressing too hard). The ADA recommends 'soft' or 'extra-soft' for almost everyone. Medium and hard brushes do more damage than they help.",
            },
            {
              q: "Can I brush too much?",
              a: "Yes — brushing more than 3 times a day, or brushing too hard, can wear down enamel and cause gum recession. The goal is twice-daily thorough brushing, not constant scrubbing. If you feel the urge to brush after every meal, rinsing with water is a better alternative.",
            },
            {
              q: "Why is the chewing surface of back teeth harder to keep clean?",
              a: "Molars have deep grooves (pits and fissures) on their chewing surface — narrow valleys where toothbrush bristles physically can't reach. That's why most cavities in kids form on chewing surfaces, and why we sometimes recommend dental sealants for those grooves. For adults, technique matters: angle the brush directly into the chewing surface and use back-and-forth strokes there.",
