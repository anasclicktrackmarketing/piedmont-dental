Most people notice these signs and assume they're normal — they aren't. Catching gum disease at this stage (gingivitis) means it's fully reversible.",
            },
            {
              q: "Why is gum disease called a 'silent' disease?",
              a: "Because it doesn't usually hurt until it's severe. Cavities cause toothache pretty quickly; gum disease can quietly destroy supporting bone for years with only subtle warning signs. The first time many patients notice anything wrong is when a tooth becomes loose — by then the disease has been progressing for a long time.",
            },
            {
              q: "Can gum disease cause me to lose my teeth?",
              a: "Yes — periodontal disease is the #1 cause of tooth loss in adults in the developed world, ahead of cavities. The disease destroys the bone and ligament that hold teeth in place. Once enough support is lost, teeth become loose and eventually fall out or need extraction. Catching it early prevents that outcome.",
            },
            {
              q: "Is gum disease linked to other health problems?",
              a: "Research has shown associations between chronic gum disease and heart disease, stroke, diabetes complications, lung infections (especially in older adults), and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The link is likely the inflammatory burden that chronic gum infection puts on the rest of the body. Treating gum disease is a quality-of-life and a general-health intervention.",
            },
            {
              q: "Can gum disease be cured?",
              a: "Gingivitis (the earliest stage) — yes, fully reversible. Periodontitis (the bone-loss stage) — no, it can be stopped and managed but the bone that's been lost doesn't regrow on its own. Treatment + ongoing maintenance keeps the disease in remission for life. The earlier we catch it, the better the long-term outcome.",
            },
            {
              q: "Is bleeding when I floss a sign of gum disease?",
              a: "Almost always, yes — bleeding gums indicate inflammation, which means bacterial plaque is sitting along or under the gumline. The fix is counterintuitive: floss more, not less. With consistent daily flossing for 1–2 weeks, healthy gums stop bleeding. If bleeding persists after 2 weeks of good home care, schedule an evaluation.",
            },
            {
              q: "What's the difference between gingivitis and periodontitis?",
              a: "Gingivitis is gum inflammation only — red, swollen, bleeding gums, but no permanent damage. Fully reversible with good home care. Periodontitis is the next stage: the inflammation has now caused bone loss around the tooth, creating periodontal pockets. Periodontitis can be stopped but not reversed; gingivitis can be.",
            },
            {
              q: "What causes gum disease in the first place?",
              a: "Bacterial plaque sitting along the gumline that isn't disrupted by daily brushing and flossing. Risk factors that make some people more susceptible: smoking (major), uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predisposition, hormonal changes (pregnancy, menopause), certain medications, and poor diet. Plaque is the cause; the risk factors determine how aggressively your body reacts to it.",
