Over that stretch it helps to have the same two people looking at your mouth. Ours is a small, owner-run practice — Dr. Jill Martenson and Dr. David Ma are the co-owners, and one of them examines you, plans the case and fits the tooth you end up chewing on.",
                "The other reason is that Piedmont is closer than most Oakland patients assume. Our office is at 1331 Grand Avenue in Piedmont, the small city surrounded on every side by Oakland; the city line is a few blocks away, and Grand Avenue runs from Lake Merritt straight up to our door — about 1.4 miles, around six minutes without traffic. Rockridge BART is about 2.6 miles and Montclair Village about 3.1 miles, each roughly seven minutes. MacArthur BART is a short drive.",

If it is, the steps are the same for every patient:",

                "A natural root keeps the jawbone working, and an implant stimulates the bone in the same way — one reason it is preferred over a bridge. Once a tooth comes out, though, the bone that held it begins to shrink. A systematic review of post-extraction changes in humans found horizontal bone loss of 29 to 63 percent and vertical loss of 11 to 22 percent within the first six months (Tan et al., cited in Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dentistry, 2026). That is why we would rather talk about an implant soon after an extraction than years later.",
                "If you have been missing the tooth for a long time and bone has been lost, a bone graft may be recommended before the implant can go in. The X-rays show what is there, and we will not pretend the bone is present when it is not. A graft adds roughly three to four months to the plan — far better to hear that at the consultation than partway through treatment.",

                "Implants are not for everyone, and we would rather say so than place one that is likely to be lost. The main risk factors for failure are smoking, uncontrolled diabetes and the poor oral hygiene that leads to peri-implantitis — inflammation of the tissue around the implant. The ADA's own list is the same: chronic illness can interfere with healing, and tobacco slows it (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "Smoking deserves its own sentence. A systematic review and meta-analysis in Medicina pooled 292 publications — 35,511 implants in smokers against 114,597 in non-smokers — and found that smokers had about 2.4 times the odds of implant failure, along with more bone loss around the implant (Mustapha, Salame and Chrcanovic, Medicina, 2021). If you smoke, we will talk about that before we plan anything, because it changes the odds and you deserve to know by how much.",
                "There are also cases where a different restoration is simply the better tool: too little bone and no appetite for grafting, a budget or timetable that a bridge fits better, or a mouth where several teeth are failing and a denture anchored on a few implants makes more sense than one implant per tooth. We lay the options out side by side below, and again in person.",

              body: [
                "A bridge replaces the missing tooth by anchoring an artificial one to the teeth on either side, which have to be filed down to carry crowns. An implant stands on its own: the neighboring teeth are untouched, and the implant stimulates the jawbone the way a natural root does. Bridges typically last ten to fifteen years; the implant post is designed to last a lifetime, and the porcelain crown on top — which typically lasts fifteen to twenty-five years — can be replaced without disturbing the implant beneath it.",
                "A removable partial or complete denture is the least invasive option, but it rests on the gums rather than in the bone, which is why it can shift when you eat or speak. Implants can also anchor a denture, giving it far more stability and comfort than it has on its own; the ADA lists bridges and dentures as the alternatives to weigh against an implant (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "The evidence on implants themselves is strong. A 2025 registry study of 158,824 implants placed in 53,874 patients reported overall implant survival of 97.79 percent, with an early-failure rate during the bone-healing phase of 1.56 percent; failures were most common in the first year and fell away after that (Journal of Functional Biomaterials, 2025). Survival is not the same as never needing attention — an implant can occasionally need re-tightening or a part replaced through normal wear — but the post itself very rarely fails.",

Most single-tooth cases run four to six months from placement to final crown: the post goes in at one surgical visit, the bone fuses around it over three to six months, and then the abutment and the custom porcelain crown are fitted. A bone graft first adds roughly three to four months, and an implant design that needs a second procedure to attach the post adds a few weeks of healing before the fittings begin. We give you a specific timeline at the consultation, after the X-rays, not before.",
                "Discomfort is usually modest. Placement is done under local anesthesia, most patients report less discomfort than a tooth extraction, and mild soreness for three to five days afterwards is normal and managed with over-the-counter pain relief. The ADA suggests soft foods while the site heals, and a temporary replacement tooth can be worn while the permanent one is being made — ask about it at the consultation if the gap shows when you smile (ADA MouthHealthy).",

We may suggest a water flosser or a small interdental brush for the implant area, because plaque collecting at the gumline is what starts trouble.",
                "The trouble to guard against is peri-implantitis — inflammation of the gum and bone around the implant, driven by poor hygiene — which is the main way an integrated implant is lost later. The habits above are the prevention. Treat the implant crown like a tooth, not a tool: no cracking ice, no opening packets, no chewing pen caps.
