Ours is an owner-run practice. Dr. Martenson and Dr. Ma are the two co-owners, and one of them examines the tooth, prepares it, designs the crown and checks it at your later cleaning visits. That continuity is the reason to drive a few minutes further up the hill.",
                "The other reason is the map. Our office is at 1331 Grand Avenue in Piedmont, and Oakland surrounds it. Lake Merritt is about 1.4 miles away, Rockridge BART about 2.6 miles and Montclair Village about 3.1 miles — six or seven minutes by car without traffic — so for a good part of Oakland we are nearer than a practice across town.",

If a crown is the right call, the preparation is the same either way: with the tooth numb, we remove any decay and shape the surface so the crown will seat properly. From there the path splits:",

              bullets: [
                "Same-day with CEREC®: we take a 3D digital scan of the prepared tooth, design the crown on screen and mill it from a solid ceramic block in our own office. The crown that goes in is the permanent one, bonded before you leave — about 1.5 to 2 hours in a single appointment, with one round of numbing instead of two and no impressions sent away.",
                "Lab-made: for larger reconstructions, and for front teeth where we are matching subtle colour and translucency across several teeth, a dental laboratory does the finer work. We take impressions, fit a temporary crown for roughly two weeks, then remove it, clean the tooth and cement the finished crown at a second visit, checking the spacing and the bite.",

It is matched to the shape, size and shade of the teeth around it, and it is durable enough to last many years. Like most dental restorations it may eventually need replacing, and we would rather say that now than have you discover it later.",
                "For a same-day crown, the ceramic blocks come in a range of shades and translucencies, and we pick the one closest to your own teeth before milling. For a front tooth between two natural ones, we choose the shade together with a guide and, if the match calls for it, use a laboratory instead.",

The American Dental Association lists the jobs a crown does: strengthen a tooth with a large filling when there isn't enough tooth left to hold the filling, protect a weak tooth from breaking, restore a broken one, cover a discoloured or badly shaped tooth, anchor a bridge or top an implant (ADA MouthHealthy). In our practice the usual reasons are:",

                "A crown means shaping the tooth all the way round, so before we recommend one we ask whether something smaller would do the job. A small cavity gets a filling. A back tooth with a broken cusp but sound walls elsewhere is often a candidate for an onlay, which covers only the damaged part; CEREC® mills onlays as well as crowns. A tooth that is the wrong colour but structurally sound may be better served by a veneer or whitening than by cutting it down.",
                "We will also say so when a crown is the wrong bet for the tooth's future. A practice-based series of 1,037 crowns found that front-tooth placement, a non-vital tooth and grinding all significantly shortened crown survival (European Journal of Oral Sciences, 2022). None of those rules a crown out, but if you clench or grind we plan for it — and if a tooth is too broken down to hold a crown, the honest conversation is about replacing it with an implant or a bridge.",

                "All three answer the same question: how much of the tooth is left. A filling fills a hole and relies on the surrounding tooth for strength. An onlay is made outside the mouth, like a crown, but covers only the chewing surface and the damaged cusp. A full crown covers everything above the gumline. The more tooth that is missing, the further along that line the right answer sits (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "The evidence on onlays is reassuring for the middle ground. A 2022 meta-analysis of six studies — one randomised trial, five observational — found no statistically significant difference in survival between tooth-coloured onlays or partial crowns and full crowns on back teeth at one year or three years, and concluded that onlays “performed as excellently as full crowns in posterior region in a short-term period” (Head & Face Medicine, 2022). Short-term is the honest qualifier: onlays have not been followed for as many years as full crowns have.",
                "In the chair, that means: sound walls, we usually suggest the onlay and keep the rest of the tooth; thin, cracked or undermined walls, the crown is the safer investment.",

The tooth is numbed and prepared, the scan takes a few minutes, the design and milling happen while you wait, and the crown is tried in, adjusted, polished and bonded. You leave with the finished tooth and nothing to come back for beyond normal check-ups.",
                "A lab-made crown means two visits about two weeks apart: preparation, impressions and a temporary crown at the first; at the second, the temporary comes off, the tooth is cleaned and the permanent crown is cemented, with the spacing and bite checked.",
                "For the first few days a new crown feels new — your tongue notices the shape, and you may feel it when you bite. Most people stop noticing within a week. If it feels tall or rocks against a neighbour, call us for a quick bite adjustment.",

The vulnerable spot is the margin where crown meets tooth, especially where the gum has receded and exposed root surface, which is why we still check every crown at your cleaning visits and on X-rays. Brush and floss around it exactly as you would a natural tooth.",

That is one series from one institution, not a pooled review — a guide, not a promise. Same-day crowns have long-term data of their own: a prospective study of 34 chairside lithium disilicate crowns, milled on a CEREC® unit, reported 80.1 percent survival after a mean of 15.2 years, which its authors called acceptable (Clinical Oral Investigations, 2023) — a small study, but a long one.",
