Piedmont is the small city Oakland surrounds, and our office at 1331 Grand Avenue sits a few blocks above the city line: about 1.4 miles from Lake Merritt, 2.6 miles from Rockridge BART and 3.1 miles from Montclair Village, six or seven minutes each without traffic.

Most cosmetic cases here use six to eight upper veneers — the teeth that show when you smile — and a single veneer is common for one chipped or stained tooth. The American Dental Association lists chipped, stained, crooked or misshapen teeth and gaps among the things veneers correct (ADA MouthHealthy). We recommend them for:",

                "Because enamel is removed, a veneer is not reversible — the ADA says so in as many words (ADA MouthHealthy) — so we say no more often than you might expect. If you clench or grind, or have a deep overbite, the ADA notes veneers may not be a good choice, and that habit has to be understood before any porcelain goes on. Significantly crowded or rotated teeth usually do better with Invisalign® first and veneers afterwards, if still needed. A structurally damaged or decayed tooth needs a crown, not a shell.",
                "What lies underneath matters too. A 2025 study of 672 veneers followed for up to fifteen years found 96.7 percent survival when the veneer was bonded entirely to enamel, against 93.9 percent when more than 30 percent of the surface was dentin; any dentin exposure raised the odds of failure about three and a half times (Etienne et al., Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry, 2025). That is why we keep preparations thin, and why heavily worn teeth are sometimes a crown conversation instead. And if what you actually want is a whiter smile, we will say so: porcelain cannot be bleached, so we whiten natural teeth first and match the veneers to the new shade.",

It costs less, removes little or no enamel and is easy to repair, but the ADA notes it is not as stain- or wear-resistant as porcelain (ADA MouthHealthy); in our experience it lasts five to seven years before it needs refreshing. It suits a small chip, a single edge, or someone not ready for something irreversible.",

It is right when a tooth is structurally weak or decayed, and wrong for a sound tooth that simply looks wrong, because it removes far more tooth than a veneer; the ADA draws the same line between covering the front surface and the entire tooth structure (ADA MouthHealthy).",

The second is the preparation visit — shaping, impression, shade — and the longest of the three. The laboratory then needs about two weeks. The third is the bonding visit, when the veneers are tried in, adjusted and cemented for good. Whitening, if you want it, comes before the preparation visit so the shade we match is the one you will keep.",

Veneers that covered the biting edge failed less often than those that did not, which is how ours are designed.",
