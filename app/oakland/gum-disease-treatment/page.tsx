Gum disease is often silent, meaning symptoms may not appear until the advanced stages (American Academy of Periodontology), which is why we measure for it at every exam rather than waiting for something to hurt. This page covers how we stage and treat it, who needs a deep cleaning and who only needs a regular one, what surgery is for, what the first two months look like, and how to get here from Oakland.",

Here that is one of the two co-owners, Dr. Jill Martenson or Dr. David Ma, working with the same hygiene team — not whoever happens to be on the schedule. For a condition you will be watching for years, that continuity is worth the extra few minutes up the hill.",

Our office is at 1331 Grand Avenue in Piedmont, the small city that Oakland wraps around, and the city line is a few blocks away. Grand Avenue runs from Lake Merritt straight to our door, about 1.4 miles. Rockridge BART is about 2.6 miles and Montclair Village about 3.1 miles, each roughly a seven-minute drive without traffic. MacArthur BART is a short drive.",

Plaque that is not removed spreads below the gum line, and the toxins its bacteria produce irritate the gums and set off a chronic inflammatory response (American Academy of Periodontology). The pocket between tooth and gum fills with bacteria, plaque and tartar, and the bone supporting the tooth begins to go. So your dentist and hygienist measure that pocket at every tooth — one to three millimeters is healthy, four is borderline, five or more needs treatment — check for bleeding and recession, and review your X-rays for bone loss. Together those findings give you a stage, and the stage decides the treatment:",

At this stage the disease is reversible with professional treatment and good at-home care (American Academy of Periodontology).",

Tartar, plaque and bacterial toxins are removed from above and below the gum line (scaling) and rough spots on the root surfaces are smoothed (planing) so the gum tissue can heal and the pockets shrink. It is usually done one quadrant of the mouth at a time while the area is numb.",

Smoking, diabetes, some medications, stress, genetics, crowded teeth, hormonal changes and poor nutrition all raise the odds of gum disease (CDC), and smoking is first on that list. None of these change whether we will see you; they change how closely we watch you and how we plan your maintenance.",

The American Academy of Periodontology's position is that controlled studies have found similar results with laser treatment compared with other non-surgical options, including scaling and root planing alone — and that the FDA clearance process did not determine that any medication delivered through a tray system has been proven a safe or effective way to treat gum disease. Neither is a shortcut past the deep cleaning.",

Daily brushing and flossing are half of the cure for gingivitis, alongside professional treatment (American Academy of Periodontology), but they can do nothing about tartar: once plaque has hardened, it cannot be removed with a toothbrush and professional treatment is needed (CDC). Below the gum line, that removal is exactly what scaling is.",
                "Scaling and root planing. This is the first-line, non-surgical treatment for periodontitis. The American Academy of Periodontology's summary is worth quoting: “Many patients do not require additional treatment after scaling and root planing. However, the majority of patients will require ongoing maintenance therapy to sustain periodontal health.” For most people the deep cleaning is the treatment; the maintenance visits are what make it hold.",
                "Surgery. When pockets stay deep after the deep cleaning, surgery reduces them so the teeth can be kept clean and the disease slowed — by folding the gum back to clean the root and bone, or by using membranes, bone grafts or tissue-stimulating proteins to encourage regeneration. It answers what the re-evaluation shows; it is not a starting point.",

Milder cases can sometimes be finished in one or two visits. Four to six weeks after the last one you come back for a re-evaluation, where every pocket is measured again to see how far it has shrunk. Active treatment for moderate-to-severe disease therefore typically runs four to eight weeks.",

The CDC puts daily brushing and flossing, regular professional cleanings and at least yearly check-ups at the center of prevention, and that does not change after treatment. Bleeding that continues after two weeks of consistent flossing is a reason to call us, not a reason to floss less.",

The American Academy of Periodontology's position is that most patients need ongoing maintenance therapy after scaling and root planing, and skipping visits is what allows the disease to come back.

Delta Dental's own published range is lower, at $180 to $295 per quadrant without benefits, with a periodontal maintenance visit at $140 to $220 (Delta Dental) — a fair illustration of how widely quoted ranges differ. Those are national market figures, not our fees; costs vary by region, severity and the number of quadrants treated, and only an examination produces a real number.",
