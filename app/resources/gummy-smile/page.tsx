                A &ldquo;gummy smile&rdquo; is when more gum tissue shows above
                the teeth than feels balanced when you smile. It&apos;s common,
                completely treatable, and the right approach depends on what&apos;s
                causing it. Here&apos;s how we evaluate and treat it at
                Piedmont Dental.

                <p>
                  Clinicians use the term when more than about 3&nbsp;mm of gum
                  shows when you smile. It&apos;s not a health problem on its
                  own — many patients simply feel self-conscious about the
                  proportion between gum and tooth in photos and conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The good news: it&apos;s one of the most fixable cosmetic
                  concerns we see. Treatments range from non-surgical contouring
                  to short procedures performed right here in our office.

              <h2>What causes a gummy smile?</h2>
              <p>
                Several different factors can produce the same visual result.
                The treatment that&apos;ll work best for you depends on which
                cause is at play — sometimes more than one.

                    <strong>Excess gum tissue (altered passive eruption)</strong>
                    <p>
                      The gums never fully receded as the teeth erupted, leaving
                      teeth that look short. This is one of the most common
                      causes and is usually addressed with crown lengthening or
                      gum contouring.

                    <strong>A hyperactive upper lip</strong>
                    <p>
                      The muscles that raise the upper lip pull too high when
                      you smile, exposing extra gum. Options include
                      neuromodulator injections (Botox) or, in select cases,
                      lip-repositioning surgery.

                    <p>
                      Teeth that have erupted too far down, or worn-down edges
                      that have shortened the teeth, can make the gum line
                      appear too prominent. Orthodontics or restorative work can
                      rebalance the smile.

                    <p>
                      In rarer cases, the upper jaw grew longer than usual,
                      pushing the gum line down. Surgical correction may be
                      considered for severe cases — but most patients see
                      excellent results with simpler in-office options.

                Dr. Martenson will walk through which of these is right for you
                during a cosmetic consultation. Many patients combine two
                approaches — for example, crown lengthening followed by veneers
                — for the most natural-looking result.

              <h2>What does treatment involve?</h2>
              <p>
                Most patients are surprised by how straightforward the process
                is. Here&apos;s the typical flow from consultation to results.

                <li>
                  <strong>Cosmetic evaluation.</strong> Dr. Martenson examines
                  your gum line, lip dynamics, and tooth proportions, then
                  recommends the simplest treatment that&apos;ll achieve the
                  look you want.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Treatment planning.</strong> Using digital photos and
                  imaging, we map out the new gum line so you can preview the
                  outcome before committing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The procedure itself.</strong> In-office contouring
                  takes 30&ndash;60 minutes under local anesthesia. Surgical
                  crown lengthening is similar — comfortable, with no general
                  anesthesia required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Healing & follow-up.</strong> Most gum tissue heals in
                  3&ndash;4 weeks. We&apos;ll see you back to confirm symmetry
                  and discuss any restorative steps (like veneers) if
                  they&apos;re part of your plan.

                  <strong>Results are typically permanent</strong> for surgical

                  require periodic touch-ups every 3&ndash;6 months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Healthy gums come first.</strong> If you have active
                  gum disease, we&apos;ll address that before any cosmetic work
                  — it&apos;s essential for a lasting result.

                  <strong>It&apos;s OK to start small.</strong> Many patients
                  begin with the most conservative option and decide later
                  whether to add veneers or orthodontics. We&apos;ll never push
                  more treatment than you need.
