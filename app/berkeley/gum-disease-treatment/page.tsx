It is diagnosed by measurement, treated in stages, and then kept quiet with maintenance visits for years afterwards — which is why the practice you choose matters more than whether it sits in Berkeley or a few minutes south of it. This page explains how we treat gum disease, who needs a deep cleaning and who does not, how scaling and root planing compares with surgery and with simply brushing harder, what the first two months look like, and the practical business of getting here from Berkeley.

                "Berkeley has no shortage of dental offices, so it is fair to ask why anyone would drive past them. The honest answer is continuity. Gum disease is managed over years, not fixed in an afternoon: the pockets around your teeth are measured, treated, measured again and then checked every few months for a long time afterwards. In our office the dentist who takes those first measurements and plans your treatment is one of the two co-owners, Dr. Martenson or Dr. Ma, and the same practice carries you through the deep cleaning and every maintenance visit after it. Nothing is handed off between stages.",
                "The drive is shorter than most people expect. Our office is at 1331 Grand Avenue in Piedmont, the small hill city a few minutes south of Elmwood and Claremont. From Elmwood, at College and Ashby, it is about 2.8 miles and nine minutes without traffic; from Claremont, at Ashby and Domingo, about 3.6 miles and eleven minutes; from Downtown Berkeley BART about 4.3 miles and thirteen minutes. If you would rather not drive, AC Transit's Line 88 runs from Downtown Berkeley straight into Piedmont and ends about a mile from our door.",

                "Treatment is matched to the stage of the disease, and the stage is found by measuring rather than guessing. At your first visit we measure the pocket depth at every tooth with a small probe — one to three millimeters is healthy, four is borderline, five or more needs treatment — check for bleeding and recession, and read digital X-rays for bone loss. Together those tell us whether you have gingivitis, which is inflammation without bone loss, or periodontitis, where the bone that supports the teeth has started to go.",
                "Gum disease begins in the pocket between tooth and gum, where bacteria, plaque and tartar collect and irritate the tissue; left alone, that irritation damages the gum and then the bone beneath it. The American Academy of Periodontology describes the mildest form, gingivitis, as red, swollen gums that bleed easily, and notes that it is reversible with professional treatment and good home care (American Academy of Periodontology). What we do depends on which side of that line you are on:",

                "Treatment is also for people who have been told they have “pockets” at another office and want a second, measured opinion before agreeing to a deep cleaning; for patients who moved to Berkeley and let a few years slip; and for anyone whose regular cleanings have started to bleed more than they used to.

If your measurements show gingivitis and no bone loss, we will say so, book one or two regular cleanings and coach your home care — and you will have driven down from Berkeley for a smaller answer than you feared, which is the right outcome.",
                "At the other end, scaling and root planing has limits. If the pockets have not healed at the re-evaluation, repeating the deep cleaning is not the answer; periodontal surgery to reduce the pocket depth may be, because shallower pockets are easier to keep clean and slow the disease. The American Academy of Periodontology's position is the same: when non-surgical treatment does not get the gums healthy, gum surgery may be recommended (American Academy of Periodontology). For advanced surgical care we may refer you on rather than stretch a treatment past what it can do.",
                "Two more honest notes. Periodontitis is managed, not cured — bone that has been lost does not grow back after a deep cleaning, so anyone promising a one-time fix is promising too much. And the CDC lists smoking, diabetes and poor oral hygiene as the factors associated with serious gum disease (CDC); a deep cleaning removes the tartar, but it does not change those, and we will talk about them plainly.",

                "Brushing harder is the comparison people rarely say out loud, so it deserves the first answer. Brushing and flossing control plaque, the soft film that forms every day. Once plaque has hardened into tartar below the gumline, a brush does not reach it — and removing it is exactly what scaling is. The American Dental Association defines scaling and root planing as a deep cleaning below the gumline used to treat gum disease, needed when the pockets between gums and teeth have become too deep (ADA MouthHealthy). Better brushing is essential after treatment; it is not a substitute for it.",
                "Scaling and root planing is the first-line treatment for periodontitis, and for most people it is the only one they need. The AAP puts it directly: many patients do not require additional treatment after scaling and root planing, although the majority will need ongoing maintenance to keep their gums healthy (American Academy of Periodontology). It is non-surgical, done under local anesthetic, and it treats the cause — bacteria and tartar on the root — rather than the symptom.",
                "Surgery is for pockets that stay deep after a proper deep cleaning and a fair chance to heal. It reduces pocket depth so the teeth can be kept clean, and it is a bigger undertaking. The order matters: a deep cleaning first, measurement, then surgery only if the measurements say so. We do not skip to surgery — and skipping the deep cleaning in favor of brushing harder is how a manageable case becomes an advanced one.",

                "For moderate to advanced periodontitis, active treatment usually runs four to eight weeks. The deep cleaning is done a quadrant at a time, typically across two visits about two weeks apart — half the mouth at each, so you always have a comfortable side to chew on. Milder cases can sometimes be finished in one or two visits; the most extensive are split across four. A re-evaluation follows at four to six weeks, when we measure every pocket again.",
                "Expect the treated side to be sore for a day or two, and the teeth to be sensitive for up to a week; the gums may be swollen, tender and bleed a little while they heal (ADA MouthHealthy). If a pocket needs extra help, medication can be placed directly into it (ADA MouthHealthy). Only the treated area is numbed, so you can drive yourself back up to Berkeley.",
                "At the re-evaluation, healed pockets mean you move to maintenance. Pockets that are unchanged or deeper mean more treatment, which is the conversation described above — and it is a conversation, not a surprise.",

The AAP is candid that the majority of patients need this ongoing maintenance to sustain periodontal health (American Academy of Periodontology); so are we. Skipping it is what allows the disease to come back.",
