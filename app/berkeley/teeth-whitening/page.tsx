            "Berkeley has no shortage of dentists, so the fair question is why anyone would drive down to Piedmont for something as routine as whitening. Our answer is the supervision that comes with it: an examination before any gel touches your teeth, trays made from impressions of your own mouth, and one of the two co-owners checking your shade at every visit. This page covers how whitening works here, who it helps and who it won't, how in-office treatment compares with take-home trays and drugstore strips, what it costs on the open market, and the practical business of getting here from Berkeley — by car or on the 88 bus.",

What you are really choosing is the person who decides whether your teeth should be bleached at all, how strong the gel should be, and what to do when they turn sensitive on day three. Here that person is Dr. Martenson or Dr. Ma at every visit: the dentist who examines you is the one who fits your trays and checks your shade, not a rotating associate.",

Even from Downtown Berkeley BART or the UC Berkeley campus you are looking at 4.3 to 4.4 miles and about thirteen minutes.",

The American Dental Association's clinical guidance says the same thing: a clinical exam, with X-rays where appropriate, before bleaching begins, to identify what is actually behind the color (ADA Oral Health Topics). If whitening is the right tool, you choose between two routes:",

At the second you try them on, we adjust the fit, and you go home with professional-strength gel. Depending on how deep the staining is and how white you want to go, you wear the trays either twice a day for 30 minutes or overnight, for a couple of weeks.",
                "In-office whitening, for patients who want the change in a single appointment. The ADA describes in-office products as concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions applied for up to 30 minutes (ADA Oral Health Topics), and chairside bleaching usually needs only one visit (ADA MouthHealthy).",

Carbamide peroxide, the usual choice for trays, breaks down in the mouth into hydrogen peroxide at roughly a third of its labelled strength, which is part of why tray whitening is gentler (Journal of Applied Oral Science, 2018).",

The ADA's patient guidance is blunt: whitening “will not work on caps, veneers, crowns or fillings,” and it is unlikely to help when the discoloration comes from a tooth injury or from certain medications (ADA MouthHealthy). Gray-toned teeth are the other hard case — they may not change at all (ADA MouthHealthy). For those, a veneer or bonding that covers the color rather than lightening it is often the honest recommendation, and we can walk you through both.",
                "Whitening also waits when there is something more urgent to treat. If the exam finds decay or gum disease, that comes first and the bleaching afterwards. Peroxide gel that reaches the gums can irritate them; the ADA describes that irritation as typically transient and resolving shortly after treatment, and a tray made from your own impressions is the way to keep the gel on the enamel and off the gums in the first place (ADA Oral Health Topics).",
                "One more honest limit: if you are pregnant or nursing, we ask you to wait. Not because harm has been shown, but because peroxide gels have not been formally studied in those groups, and we would rather be cautious.",

For anyone planning new dental work, that means the order matters.",

Do it the other way round and the older restoration becomes a visibly darker island in a whiter smile, and the only fix is to remake it. If you already have visible fillings or crowns on front teeth, we will assess at the consultation whether they should be replaced after bleaching so that everything matches — a decision made with you up front, not a surprise afterwards.",

If you want the change for a particular date and can accept a day of sensitivity, in-office. If you want the most control with the least sensitivity, trays. If your staining is mild and your teeth are sound, strips are not a bad start — but see us first. The detail:",

Across clinical trials the average absolute risk of tooth sensitivity is about 63 percent for in-office bleaching against about 51 percent for at-home trays — an average across studies, not a single trial (Journal of Applied Oral Science, 2018). It is usually mild and tends to fade within 24 hours of the session (same source).",

The gels typically run from 10 to 38 percent carbamide peroxide (ADA Oral Health Topics) — strong enough to shift real staining, but slower and gentler than chairside treatment. Because the trays are made from impressions of your teeth, the gel stays on the enamel and off the gums, and a course takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "Over-the-counter strips and kits: the cheapest way in, and reasonable for mild surface stain. The bleach concentration is lower than what a dentist would use (ADA MouthHealthy), the strip is one size for every mouth, and nobody has examined your teeth first, so a crown, a gray tooth or an early cavity gets the same treatment as everything else. If you go this route anyway, the ADA suggests a product carrying its Seal of Acceptance, which means it has been tested for safety and effectiveness (ADA MouthHealthy).",

From there the work happens at home in Berkeley — 30 minutes twice a day, or overnight, for a couple of weeks, depending on the starting shade and how much lighter you want to go. We look at the result at your next check-up and send you off with touch-up gel to keep.",
