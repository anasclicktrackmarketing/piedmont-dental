From the first X-rays to the finished crown it runs across several months and a number of visits, and the tooth then needs checking for as long as you have it. That makes the office more important than the brand of implant. Ours is owner-run: the dentist who examines you, plans the case and fits the final crown is one of the two co-owners, and the same two dentists see you for the cleanings and check-ups that keep the implant healthy afterwards.",

Elmwood, at College and Ashby, is about 2.8 miles from our door — around nine minutes without traffic — and Claremont is about 3.6 miles, or eleven minutes. From Downtown Berkeley or the UC campus it is roughly 4.3 to 4.4 miles and thirteen minutes; from North Berkeley, about 4.9 miles and fifteen.

The American Dental Association describes implants as posts, made of titanium and other body-compatible materials, that are surgically placed in the upper or lower jaw and act as a sturdy anchor for a replacement tooth; what makes them strong is that the bone grows around the post and holds it, a process called osseointegration (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "Treatment starts with a complimentary consultation with Dr. Martenson or Dr. Ma. We take digital and panoramic X-rays and, where the case needs it, a 3D scan, to measure the bone, the gum tissue and the space available — then tell you plainly whether an implant is the right tool, or whether a bridge, a denture or a graft first would serve you better.

If you have been missing the tooth for years and the bone has shrunk, a bone graft may need to come first, which adds three to four months before the post can go in; we will say so, and explain the alternative if you would rather not wait. If a chronic illness such as diabetes is not well controlled, the ADA notes it may interfere with healing after surgery, and some patients with these conditions are not good candidates (ADA MouthHealthy).",
                "Smoking is the one we are most direct about. A 2021 meta-analysis in the journal Medicina, pooling 292 studies and more than 150,000 implants, found that implants in smokers failed at 2.4 times the odds of those in non-smokers and lost more bone around the post (Mustapha, Salame and Chrcanovic, 2021). The ADA puts it more simply: tobacco slows healing (ADA MouthHealthy). We do not turn smokers away, but we tell you the numbers before you decide.",

An implant stands alone: the neighbouring teeth are untouched, and the post stimulates the jawbone the way a natural root does, which is why the bone around it holds up. The bridge is quicker — nothing is placed in the bone, so there are no months of healing — and for some mouths it remains the sensible choice; the consultation is where we say which.",
                "A removable denture is the least invasive option and the least secure. Where several teeth are missing, implants and dentures are not rivals: the ADA notes that custom bridges or dentures can be made to fit your mouth and your implants (ADA MouthHealthy), and a denture anchored to implants stays put in a way a conventional one cannot. Which of the three fits you depends on the bone available, the health of the neighbouring teeth, how long you want the result to last and what you are prepared to go through to get it — we lay those out side by side rather than lead with the most expensive option.",

The post needs three to six months to fuse with the bone before it can carry a tooth, and cases that need a graft first add three to four months. Placement itself is done under local anesthesia; most patients describe less discomfort than a tooth extraction, with mild soreness for three to five days that over-the-counter pain relief handles.",

The American Academy of Periodontology calls this peri-implant disease. In its milder form, peri-implant mucositis, the inflammation is confined to the gum with no bone loss, and it is reversible if caught early; in peri-implantitis the bone supporting the implant starts to break down, and treatment usually means surgery. The warning signs are the same as gum disease — red or tender gums around the implant, or bleeding when you brush — and the risk factors it lists are a previous diagnosis of gum disease, poor plaque control, smoking and diabetes (American Academy of Periodontology).",

Implants need regular brushing, flossing and professional check-ups just as teeth do (American Academy of Periodontology), so brush twice a day, floss around the implant as you would a tooth, and keep the six-monthly visits, where we check the gum and the bone level on X-rays. We may suggest a water flosser or a small interdental brush for the implant area. One habit to drop: using a front implant to bite ice, pen caps or anything else hard.",
