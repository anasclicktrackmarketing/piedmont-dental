This page answers it plainly: what the treatment involves here, who it suits and who it doesn't, how porcelain compares with bonding and crowns, what the long-term evidence actually shows, and how to reach Piedmont from Berkeley by car, bus or BART. It is the same ground we cover, without charge, at a consultation.",

How much enamel to keep, where each edge should fall, which shade reads as natural beside your other teeth — these are judgment calls, and here they are made by one of the two co-owners, Dr. Martenson or Dr. Ma, who examines you, prepares the teeth, matches the color in person and bonds the porcelain. The same dentist sees you at every visit. For a treatment the ADA describes as not reversible (ADA MouthHealthy), that continuity is worth a few extra miles.",

From Elmwood, at College and Ashby, it is about 2.8 miles and roughly nine minutes without traffic; from Claremont, at Ashby and Domingo, about 3.6 miles and eleven minutes; from Downtown Berkeley BART or the UC Berkeley campus, about 4.3 to 4.4 miles and thirteen minutes.

We look closely at the teeth you want to change and the ones beside them, check your gums and bite, and take X-rays where we need to rule out decay underneath — the ADA is clear that decay or gum disease must be treated before a veneer is placed (ADA MouthHealthy). Then we talk about what you actually want to see in the mirror and whether porcelain is the honest way to get there. If it is, treatment runs over two visits, usually with little or no anesthetic, and follows the same steps for everyone:",

                "Bonding. At the second visit the teeth are cleaned with conditioning liquids so the cement can grip, each veneer is seated in bonding cement, and a curing light sets it hard.",

                "How many you need depends on what shows when you smile: one veneer can rescue a single chipped or dark tooth, most cosmetic cases use six to eight across the upper front teeth, and a full smile design can run to ten upper and eight lower.

If you clench or grind your teeth, or have a deep overbite, the ADA says veneers may not be a good choice — and because fracture is the most common way a veneer fails, according to a 2021 systematic review of 6,500 veneers in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, we take that warning seriously. If a tooth is structurally damaged or heavily decayed, a crown that covers the whole tooth is the right repair, not a veneer. And if the underlying issue is crowding or a bite that is off, straightening first with Invisalign® — with veneers afterwards only if they are still wanted — is the more conservative route.",

                "Composite bonding is tooth-colored resin shaped directly onto the tooth in a single visit. It needs less enamel removed and fewer visits, it costs less, and if it chips it can be patched in the chair — the ADA notes that composite is easier to fix if damaged (ADA MouthHealthy). The trade is that composite is not as stain- or wear-resistant as porcelain (ADA MouthHealthy), so it dulls and roughens sooner. For one small chip, or a change you want to try before committing, bonding is often the sensible choice; for several teeth at once, or a result you want to keep for a decade or more, porcelain is the longer answer.",
                "A crown covers the whole tooth, all the way round, and is the answer when the tooth itself is weak, cracked or heavily decayed. A veneer covers only the front face and the biting edge. On a healthy front tooth that simply looks wrong, a veneer keeps far more of your own tooth; on a damaged one, a crown is the safer structure.",
                "Two smaller notes. Whitening bleaches natural teeth only — porcelain does not change shade — so if you want a brighter smile overall, we whiten first and match the veneers to the new color. And a few teeth that are naturally small or worn can take a “no-prep” veneer with almost no enamel removed; we will tell you if yours qualify rather than promise it in advance.",

Because the consultation is free and the drive is short, we would rather you come once and talk than decide from a website. Bring examples of smiles you like and smiles you don't — the aim is a result that fits your face, not a magazine cover, and the commonest cosmetic mistake is veneers that are too white or too uniform.",
                "The preparation visit covers shaping, impression and shade. The laboratory then makes the veneers, which is what the gap between visits is for; there is nothing for you to attend in between. At the bonding visit the teeth are conditioned, each veneer is cemented and cured in place, and you leave with the finished smile and your care instructions.",

                "Porcelain veneers are durable but not permanent, and we say so up front: like any restoration, they may one day need replacing. The long-term numbers are reassuring. A 2021 systematic review of 25 studies and 6,500 porcelain veneers put ten-year cumulative survival at 95.5 percent; counting fracture alone the figure was 96.3 percent, and debonding alone 99.2 percent (Journal of Clinical Medicine, 2021). A 2024 meta-analysis of 7,753 veneers followed for an average of 10.4 years found the same pattern, with survival between roughly 94 and 97 percent depending on the ceramic (Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry, 2024).",
                "Which side of those numbers you land on is largely settled before the veneer is made. Enamel is the big one: in a 2025 study of 672 veneers followed for one to fifteen years, those bonded entirely to enamel survived at 96.7 percent against 93.9 percent where more than 30 percent of the bonded surface was dentin, and any dentin exposure raised the odds of failure 3.47 times (Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry, 2025). Design matters too: the 2021 review found veneers that stopped short of the biting edge failed more often than those that covered it. Both shape how conservatively we prepare each tooth and how the porcelain is designed.",

                "The habits that shorten a veneer's life are the ones that chip natural teeth: biting fingernails, tearing packaging open with your teeth, chewing ice. Porcelain does not stain the way composite does, but it does not bleach either, so a veneer that looks dull beside teeth you have since whitened cannot be lightened, only replaced. And a veneer can chip, crack, wear or loosen over time; when it does, the ADA's guidance is that your dentist re-bonds, repairs or replaces it (ADA MouthHealthy) — a phone call and a short drive down from Berkeley.",
