Berkeley patients see Dr. Jill Martenson and Dr. David Ma at our office on Grand Avenue in Piedmont — about 2.8 miles from Elmwood and roughly nine minutes from Ashby BART without traffic — and for many teeth the permanent CEREC® crown is scanned, milled and bonded in that single visit.",
            "Berkeley is not short of dentists, so a drive down the hill deserves a reason. Ours is a small, owner-run practice where the dentist who prepares your tooth is the one who fits the crown, checks the bite and looks after it at every cleaning for years afterwards — and where a same-day crown turns two trips into one. Below: how crowns are made here, who needs one and who doesn't, how a crown compares with an onlay or a big filling, what the appointments look like, what the published market ranges say about cost, and the practical business of getting here from Berkeley by car, BART or the 88 bus.",

                "A crown is one of the longest-lived things a dentist makes for you, and it is judged over years, not days: how the margin seals, how the bite settles, how the tooth underneath holds up. That is a better bet when one person owns the whole story. Here the dentist who examines the tooth, prepares it, designs the crown and adjusts it is one of the two co-owners — and the same dentist sees that crown at every cleaning that follows.",
                "The second reason is the calendar. Where a crown is made by a laboratory it takes two appointments about two weeks apart, with a temporary crown in between. For many teeth we skip all of that: a 3D scan replaces the impressions, the crown is milled from a ceramic block in our own office, and the permanent crown is bonded before you leave. One drive down, one round of numbing, nothing to come back for.",
                "And the drive is shorter than Berkeley people expect. From the Elmwood end — College and Ashby — we are about 2.8 miles and nine minutes without traffic; from Claremont, at Ashby and Domingo, about 3.6 miles and eleven minutes. Downtown Berkeley BART is about 4.3 miles and thirteen minutes, the UC Berkeley campus about 4.4, and even North Berkeley, at Shattuck and Vine, is about 4.9 miles and fifteen minutes.",

We examine the tooth, take digital and panoramic X-rays, and tell you plainly which restoration the tooth needs — a crown, a smaller onlay, or simply a filling — and, if it is a crown, whether we can make it the same day or whether a laboratory should.",
                "The laboratory route takes two appointments. At the first, the tooth is numbed, decay is removed and the surface is shaped to fit the crown; we take accurate impressions for the laboratory and fit a temporary crown with temporary cement, then check your bite. About two weeks later the temporary comes off, the tooth is cleaned, and the permanent crown is fitted with the spacing and bite checked again. We recommend this route for larger reconstructions, and for front teeth where subtle color and translucency have to be matched across several teeth.",

A small or mid-size cavity is a filling: the ADA describes tooth-colored composite as a mix of glass or quartz filler that gives good durability and resistance to fracture in small- to mid-size fillings under moderate chewing pressure (ADA MouthHealthy). A tooth that has lost a corner but is otherwise sound is often an onlay, which covers only the damaged part — Delta Dental puts it simply: onlays can be used if the tooth isn't badly damaged (Delta Dental). We mill ceramic onlays and inlays on the same CEREC® system we use for crowns.",
                "Two things also decide whether a same-day ceramic crown is right for you. Our CEREC® page names the exceptions: patients with a history of breaking ceramic restorations, and patients with a very deep bite. For them we talk through the alternatives before choosing a material. And if you grind or clench, tell us — in a 20-year clinical series, bruxism was one of three factors that significantly shortened crown survival, along with front-tooth placement and teeth whose nerve had died (European Journal of Oral Sciences, 2022). We would rather plan around it than find out later.",

You walk out with the permanent crown in place and drive back up to Berkeley once.",

The first visit — Delta Dental puts it at around 60 to 90 minutes — is the preparation, the impressions and the temporary crown; the second, about two weeks later, is fitting the permanent crown and checking the spacing and bite (Delta Dental). The temporary is held with temporary cement, so if it comes loose before the second visit, call us.",

So a crown is looked after the way a tooth is: brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, floss every day, and keep your regular visits (Delta Dental). We check every crown at every cleaning and on your X-rays, because a new cavity at the margin is what fails first, not the porcelain.",

A retrospective series of 1,037 single crowns in 401 patients, followed for an average of about eleven years, found 89.9 percent still in place at five years, 80.9 percent at ten, 70.5 percent at fifteen and 61.8 percent at twenty; the main reasons for failure were loss of retention, loss of the tooth and fracture, and the crown material made no measurable difference (European Journal of Oral Sciences, 2022). That is one teaching clinic's caseload over decades, not a systematic review, and it includes the front-tooth and dead-nerve cases the same study found fail sooner.",
